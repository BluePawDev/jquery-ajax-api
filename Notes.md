# APIs, jQuery, and AJAx
## APIs
Application Program Interface
* Format of request expects
* Format of response
### REST APIs
* Representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful
* Additional Information: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer
* Rely on fact that HTTP is the protocol of the web
* Example: GET localhost:3000
* GET request is very specific meaning that we are requesting data
#### What to know to understand REST APIs
* *HTTP methods* define what to do
* *Resources* are the thing we plan to perform the HTTP method on:
  - We can get to a resource by specifying in the URL
* *HTTP headers* tell us the status of the request (e.g. was it successful) via *HTTP status codes*
* *HTTP bodies* contain data that may be needed for the request and/or response

* GET: Retrieve a resource
* POST: Create a new resource
* PUT:
* DELETE:

* Resource/Example: www.giantbomb.com
