## APIs
Application Program Interface
* Format of request expects
* Format of responst
### REST APIs
Rely on fact that HTTP is the protocol of the web
Example: GET localhost:3000
GET request is very specific meaning that we are requesting data
#### What to know to understand REST APIs
* *HTTP methods* define what to do
* Resources are the thing we plan to perform the HTTP methon on:
  - We can get to a resource by specifying in the URL
* HTTP headers tell us the status of the request (e.g. was it successful) via HTTP status codes
* HTTP bodies contain data that may be needed for the request and/or response
